# Getting Started: PHP

## IF YOU'VE NEVER DONE THIS

**Welcome!** We're so happy you've come to check us out. Enclosed in the zip you may have just downloaded is what we call *pet code*. It should include all the files you need to complete the task.

### So you've chosen to work locally...

We actually recommend this! It's easier to get started, and faster to test and deploy to your staging environment. Below you will find a description of how to set that environment up.

*`DO NOT USE FILES THAT ARE NOT PROVIDED BY OWNER`*

## ENVIRONMENT SETUP

This is a [PHP](https://www.w3schools.com/pHP/default.asp)-based environment. That means you have a variety of setup options.

### Recommended Dev Tools

* [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or other text editors.
* [PHP](http://www.php.net/downloads.php) - May prove useful for PHP tasks, but is not always necessary.
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or any modern web browser.

*We recommend that Coders avoid older versions of Internet Explorer or mini/light browsers because they lack full functionality.*

#### Extra Considerations for DOS (Windows) Users

* [PHP](http://www.w3programmers.com/run-php-in-php-built-in-web-server/) - ***Note:*** *This will help install PHP on Windows.*
* [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or similar - A great server-building GUI for simpler PHP serving.
* *Consider Partitioning your machine with a friendly [Linux Distro](https://www.lifewire.com/ultimate-windows-8-1-ubuntu-dual-boot-guide-2200654)*.

### Serving Your Website Locally

**From the Command Line:**

```sh
# For Unix (OSX and Linux Distributions):

cd path/to/directory

php -S localhost:8080 &&  open http://localhost:8080 # You need to install PHP for this

# Without PHP:

open ./index.html # assuming the page you are opening is index.html
```

`Note: Still working on Windows quickstart`

**From Your File Explorer:**

*Find Folder with HTML file to server (usually `index.html`)* -> *Drag `.html` file to view into your internet browser of choice (e.g. Google Chrome)*

## SUBMITTING YOUR TASK

This part's easy. Hopefully you **DID NOT USE FILES THAT WERE NOT PROVIDED**. You cannot add new files to the task for security reasons (*this means you cannot change file names or non-code files*), but you can **copy and paste** the code you've written in the files provided by into our editors.

*All you have to do is paste, save, and submit!*
