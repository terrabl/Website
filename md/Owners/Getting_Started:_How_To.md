# Getting Started: How To

Hi! If you’re in this section, that means you are an Owner. Smop offers you and your software development business the opportunity to get rid of the smaller tasks in your workstream so that you can regain focus on getting the stuff you want to get done, done.

## How does it work?

It’s a simple process:

1. You post your tasks on our website, owner.smop.io, with a description and a bounty.
2. We show those tasks to competitive developers on our website smop.io. 
3. Developers submit their work on your task to us.
4. We test their code to make sure it meets your requirements.
5. We hand you back your new code, fresh and ready to integrate.

## What sort of tasks should I post on Owner.Smop.io?

We recommend posting software development tasks that you expect to take between 30 minutes to 4 hours. We are currently focused on supporting end to end web development, but testing support is expected to expand beyond this in the near future. 

## What sort of information should I provide for my task?

First, contact us at info@smop.io, and we will make sure to give you step-by-step directions to make posting your task a seamless experience.

In general, however, aside from high-level descriptions of what problem you are trying to solve, you only need to provide two things.

1. Any necessary pet code (dummy data, functions coders will be interacting with, etc.)
2. Your parth statements (easy to write statements which give us your requirements)

## What are Parth statements?

Parth statements are our way of simplifying the testing process. Now you can specify requirements for your desired code with statements as simple as “click button myButton”. We are able to use these statements to automatically generate tests to meet your requirements. The full documentation for parth files, including a how-to and worked out examples, can be found in the sidebar. 

If this is all a bit overwhelming - have no fear! We would be happy to work with you to figure out your business needs. Please don’t hesitate to contact info@smop.io.

## What sort of bounties should I post for my tasks?

We recommend paying between $20-$30 per expected hour to complete your task.

## How long does it take?

You can expect your code back in 1-3 days - plenty of time before the end of your sprint.

## What if the code I receive does not match my standards?

If your code does not match your standards, we’ll do our best to help you. Please contact info@smop.io.
